<h1>  A Linear Regression Model for Predicting Time Required for Extracting Rows </h1>

<h4> Summary : </h4>
The goal of this project was to develop a linear regression model that could accurately predict the time required to extracting/scraping rows based on given inputs. To accomplish this, I have gathered a dataset by doing experiments on webscraping and have recorded time for different row inputs, and used this data to train and test our model. The dataset contains two columns 1. number of  rows and 2. time taken for extarction</b>. After training and testing our model on the dataset, we achieved a high level of accuracy, with a low mean squared error and a high R-squared value. This suggests that our linear regression model is effective at predicting row extraction times and could be a useful tool while webscraping because we will know, how much time it will going to take to execute our request and get the response.

<h4> Problem Statement: </h4>
The original data is more than 20 milion rows. It is not possible to get the time required for extracting million of rows. To solve this problem, I came up with this Linear Regression model for Predicting time required for extracting rows. Whenever we are doing webscraping on such type, we will know, how much time it will be going take to load that data into the repository.

<h4>Methodology:</h4>
This portfolio project will use data analysis and visualization techniques to explore the datasets and uncover insights related to the distribution of rows and distribution of seconds. The analysis will include cleaning, transforming, and aggregating the data, followed by creating visualizations such as distplot, scatter plots to present the findings. The project also demonstrates the use of Python programming language and its data science libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, to perform the analysis and generate visualizations.
